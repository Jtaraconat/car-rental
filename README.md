Car-rental app 

This app was made with react and tailwind
The goal is to showcase what I can code for my portfolio
I wanted to code some basic features you can find on a rental website
You can search for a car or a van set your pickup date and return date, add some options 

I use react because it's easy to set-up and using the functional component
I use tailwind just to learn as I used bootstrap in the past just too see the differences and the ease of use 

For the future I would like to work on the design as it's not my forte
